# CMPG-323-Overview-32494122
This is a repository for CMPG 323 Projects.

###### Git Ignore
The .gitignore is used to ignore certain files that should not be available for access. Its objective is to ignore those specific files when the project is loaded onto github. 
###### Repositories
Each project is expected to have its own repository. There are 5 projects in total. Project one has been added under the repository "CMPG-323-Overview". The other remaining repositories for the projects may simply be linked to this main repository. 
###### Diagram
The diagram below basically illustrates how CMPG-323-Overview is the main repository which will consist of all 5 projects. Each project will then have its own specific repository created, of which the repository will then be linked to that specific project. Basically, you can access all the different projects through the overview, or you can access each individual project through its own repository.

###### Storage Of Credentials
Credentials will be managed by using the gitignore setup. The objective is that those files are to be ignored as they contain sensitive information such as log in details, which should be kept private. 
###### Branching Strategy
In each project, different branches namely, main, develop, feature, hotfix and release will be created. The idea with this is that the work done on a project can be seperated or isolated into a specific branch, for example the main branch can include all the work from other branches, and the hotfix branch will include fixes or edits that have been completed.
